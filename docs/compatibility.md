## Compatibility

**Breaking change notice:** Plugin `0.4.1` removes the earlier experimental
Remote business RPC surface (`sessions.*`, `session.*`, `permissions.respond`,
`sync.from`). Harness session traffic now only uses the official rc.2
`ApiProxy` or the v0.1.2 Typert Remote Gateway, and this plugin does not provide
an adapter or wire-format translation for the old RPC surface.

Plugin `0.4.27` targets DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2` and retains compatibility with `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.1`, while also supporting `dsh-v0.1.6-alpha.2` and earlier settings hosts. It supports `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.2` through the legacy
official `ApiProxy`, and `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`rc.1` through the
official Typert Remote Gateway. It also supports
`dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1`, `dsh-v0.1.6-alpha.1`, and `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2` Session V3 through the official Typert Remote
Gateway; a `0.1.6` Host reports patch `6` and therefore selects the same Session V3
profile with no wire-format adapter. A `0.4.13` Client running rc.2 remains compatible
with older rc.2 Hosts through the legacy capability fallback. `0.4.27` also reads the
running Harness version from the 0.2.0 Desktop shell's `@deepseek-ai/dsh-desktop-host`
entrypoint as well as from the CLI entrypoint, so Hosts started by the current Desktop app
keep reporting `harnessVersion` and the version-gated workspace compatibility paths
(legacy `workspaceFiles/changes`, byte-range reads) stay active.

Remote Web/Desktop and the Android app also normalize released sessions that
still report the retired `code` agent preset to `ptc`, so old sessions can
resume on `dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1` or `dsh-v0.1.6-alpha.1` without changing DeepSeek Harness itself.

Desktop endpoints must use a compatible Harness carrier. Plugin `0.4.27` selects the legacy
ApiProxy path for rc.2 Hosts when that Host exposes it, and Session V3 Desktop clients can open
legacy v0.1.2 Typert Remote Hosts through Remote-side history and event normalization. Legacy
Typert clients still reject Session V3 Hosts before switching the native UI or mutating a Workspace.
